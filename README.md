# PhageScope
Welcome to [PhageScope](https://phagescope.deepomics.org/)! PhageScope is an online bacteriophage database that offers comprehensive genome annotations, including completeness assessment, phenotype annotation, structural annotation, functional annotation, and genome comparison.

PhageScope incorporates automatic analysis and interactive visualization for both curated and customized data.

Key features of PhageScope:
+ Curated PhageScope database includes 441,637 phage sequences from 2,214 host species, harboring 23,424,959 annotated proteins, 3,912,546 terminators, 397,896 tRNA & tmRNA genes, and 32,472 CRISPR arrays.
+ Automatic phage annotation and analysis with state-of-the-art tools, including completeness scoring, host assignment, lifestyle prediction, ORF and terminator localization, functional gene annotation, genome clustering and comparison, etc. 
+ Interactive visualization of phenotype distribution, structural and functional annotation, genome comparison, phylogenetic tree, etc.
