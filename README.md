# PhageScope
Welcome to [PhageScope](https://phagescope.deepomics.org/)! PhageScope is an online bacteriophage database that offers comprehensive annotations, including completeness assessment, phenotype annotation, taxonomic annotation, structural annotation, functional annotation, and genome comparison. 

PhageScope incorporates automatic analysis and interactive visualization for both curated and customized data.

Key features of PhageScope:
+ Curated PhageScope database includes 441,637 phage sequences from 2,214 host species, harboring 23,424,959 annotated proteins, 3,912,546 terminators, 480,343 tRNA genes, 6,153 tmRNA genes, 241,377 anti-CRISPR proteins, 32,472 CRISPR arrays, 23,349 virulent factors, 2,004 antimicrobial resistance genes, and 2,189,636 transmembrane proteins. 
+ Automatic phage annotation and analysis with state-of-the-art tools, including completeness scoring, host assignment, lifestyle prediction, taxonomic classification, ORF and terminator localization, functional gene annotation, genome clustering, and sequence comparison, etc.
+ Interactive visualization of completeness and phenotype distribution, structural and functional annotation, sequence alignment, comparative tree, etc.
