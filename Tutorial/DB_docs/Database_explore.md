# How to explore PhageScope datasets
PhageScope Datasets is a comprehensive resource that provides access to a wide range of information on phages and their annotation data. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the different interfaces available on the PhageScope Database. Click ``Database`` on the navigation bar and get started.

## Overview
The ``Overview`` interface gives users a brief introduction to the PhageScope Database along with some statistics on the phage sequences, host information, annotated proteins, and other functional items.

The interface also provides overview visualizations, such as bar plot, pie chart, and tree chart, to showcase the distributions of phage source, sequence completeness, and phage lifestyle.

## Phage List
The "Phage List" interface allows you to access and download phage sequences and meta information. To access this interface, click on the "Phage List" option in the navigation bar.

+ Search and Sorting: You can search for specific phages using keywords or apply filters to narrow down your search. You can also sort the phages based on various criteria such as phage name, cluster, host, and more.

+ Download Phage Data: Once you have found the phages you are interested in, you can select them and download their data in various formats such as FASTA, GFF3, GBK, and tabular (Meta data). This allows you to obtain the sequences and other relevant information for further analysis.


## Host List
The "Host List" interface provides information about the hosts that phages infect. To access this interface, click on the "Host List" option in the navigation bar.  

+ Host Exploration: You can browse the different hosts and their associated phages. This interface enables you to study the interactions between phages and their hosts.

+ Download Host Data: If you want to explore phages that infect specific hosts, you can download the data for further analysis.


## Cluster List
The "Cluster List" interface allows you to explore phage clusters, which are groups of phages that share genetic similarities. To access this interface, click on the "Cluster List" option in the navigation bar.

+ Cluster Exploration: You can view the different phage clusters and examine their characteristics, such as the number of phages in each cluster and their associated hosts.

+ Download Cluster Data: If you find a cluster of interest, you can download the sequences and information for all phages within that cluster.

## Structural Annotation Data
### Annotated Protein List
The "Protein List" interface provides access to the protein sequences derived from the phage genomes. To access this interface, click on the "Protein List" option in the navigation bar.

+ Protein Search: You can search for specific proteins by entering keywords or protein IDs. You can also apply filters to narrow down your search based on characteristics such as protein function, phage name, length, and more.

+ Download Protein Data: Similar to the Phage List interface, you can select proteins of interest and download their sequences and associated information.

### Transmembrane Protein List


### Virulent Factor List


### Antimicrobial Resistance Gene List


## Sequence filter
The "Sequence Filter" interface allows you to filter phage sequences based on certain criteria. To access this interface, click on the "Sequence Filter" option in the navigation bar.

Filtering Options: You can apply filters to the available phage sequences based on various attributes such as phage name, cluster, host, completeness, genome size, and more. This helps in narrowing down the dataset to meet your specific research needs.

Download Filtered Data: Once you have applied the desired filters, you can download the filtered phage sequences and associated information.
